ReadMe.txt file explaining the additions and deletions to each file. 

1. road_lane_pot_str.m : This file has the code to show the road potential ( including the additions for shifted quadratic road potential).  
2. APF_Obstacle_Road1.m - This .m file contains the code to design the equations for the obstacle potential. 

   Take the changes in APF_Obstacle_Road.m and change derv1 and derv2 functions to suit the derevatives of
   -(-A ln(bK))/(bK).

   i. Removed the calculation of surface plot and the contour plot of the obstacle from Xvartempin and Yvartempin
      and replaced it with only the calculation using the inequalities used to determine the regions and therefore
      calculating the surf and contour plots. Problem is that it is done only for one obstacle and has not been extended
      to work with multiple obstacles.

3. APF_Obstacle_Road2.m: Improved APF_Obstacle_Road1.m for each region so as to work well with multiple obstacle vehicle
   works well. keep in mind that the x_h_0 values used in these region parts of the code is to be changed based
   on the number of equations as they might be so that they lie within an obstacle.
